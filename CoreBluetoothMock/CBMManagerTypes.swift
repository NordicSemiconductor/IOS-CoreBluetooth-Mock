/// of attributes used in Bluetooth low energy communication, such as a peripheral’s services,
/// characteristics, and descriptors. This class provides a number of factory methods for dealing

/// representation of a 128-bit Bluetooth low energy attribute in your code, you can create a
/// `CBMUUID` object that represents it, and pass that around instead.
